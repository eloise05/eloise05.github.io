            <br>With the recent development of AI Assistants, the concept of AI has been placed under the spotlight and become much more familiar. Collaborating with Samsung Electronics under the supervision of Professor Yong Serk KIM, who was the previous vice president of Samsung Electronics, our research team had a valuable chance to redesign Bixby, Samsung's AI Assistant with User Centered Design principles. It was a rewarding and unforgettable experience!
 <br><br> As a team leader, I actively led and encouraged the team to focus on the existing problem of Bixby. The solution named as 'My Real AI Friend, Bixby' is expected to build the rapport between the users and his/her own Bixby. Our solution takes effect and manages the system from the very first stage when users encounter Bixby. With the extraordinary teamwork and efforts spent on the project, our team won 'The Best Idea award'. We all received a 'Galaxy Watch' with the newest version of Bixby in it, encouraging the team to continue the research with it.

            <br>We conducted a user research with Galaxy phone users who have Bixby on their phone. We found out that most of the users do not use Bixby. Unfortunately, even the Galaxy phone users were not aware of how to use Bixby. With some detailed questions, we could learn that they are not used to 'AI Assistant', feeling useless. The main reason was lack of rapport between users and Bixby.

            <div id="textbox" class="subtitle4"> 
            <br>From the user interview, our team has defined the design challenge as lack of rapport between Galaxy phone users and Bixby. To overcome the problem, we made a prototype with the idea to make intimacy between the users and Bixby through "Personalization"!

We illustrated this idea by creating a persona who loves cats and demonstrated the process on how the persona personalizes his/her own Bixby.</div>
