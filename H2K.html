            <div id="textbox" class="subtitle4-yellow"> 
            <br><a href="https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/%EC%86%8C%EC%A4%91%ED%95%9C%EA%B8%80/id1372681786" target="_blank"  >H2K</a>, is a E-Learning startup that designs an app to teach Korean to children with dyslexia. 
            I worked as a UX Design intern, which was recruited as the first non-software developer. Nontheless, as I have front-end development skills, I was also engaged in many different projects closesly communicating with the whole company. <br>
            <br>
            I designed a user flow of the reward system from end to end for a powerful user engagement. 
            I aimed to design a reward system which would motivate users to study by giving them entertaining features. <br>
            Through interviewing multiple users, I realized the behavior of ‘taking a picture’ was regarded as enjoyable by kids. <br>
            Therefore, I designed a reward system that lets the user take pictures with specially designed filters when they finish certain chapters of the curriculum.

            <div id="textbox" class="subtitle36" align="left"> <br>Design Thinking Workshop <br>  </div>
            <div id="textbox" class="subtitle4-yellow"> 
            <br> 
            I had an opportunity to host a company-wide design thinking workshop to elicit and incorporate employee feedback into the development of a user-centered product.
              <br>
            It was amazing to share what is design thinking and how we can improve our product to be more user friendly by using this methodology.
        
            The following video is the introduction of the workshop. :)

            During the internship, I was happy to be involved in many different projects including product design, marketing and, data handling. 
            It was a priviledge to be highly engaged in many meetings and collaborate with every colleague in the company.
            <br> Among them, I would like to show the reward system that I designed with the methodology, Design Thinking.

             <div id="textbox" class="subtitle4-blue"> 
                 <br> Unlike other apps, this app had a specific and unique user group who are children aged from 4 to 8.
            
                 I had to redefine what is <b>reward</b>, which could give joy to the children that is enough for them to come back to the app everyday spending
                 10 mins. <br><br>
                 Through <b>observing</b> children's behaviors and having conversations with them, I could figure out that they like popping animations with fun sound effects and visual effects that could captivate their senses. 
                 Also, <b>they loved taking pictures</b>! From their parents' smartphone gallery apps, I could find happy smiles on every single children's face! :)

                 <br> Finally, we designed two main reward systems.

                 <br>
                 <b>1) Fun Filters</b> <br>

                <br>
                Fun filter would be given to the user after finishing 3 days of lesson. 
                Fun filters are actually connected to each other! Every filter has its story (Korean Traditional fairy tales) and it could be seen a new story as a whole.
            
                 <br>
                The apple effect will be shown to the user(kid) after he/she finishes his/her daily lesson.

             <div id="textbox" class="subtitle4-blue"> 
                 <br> As a UX Designer, it was amazing to interact with the users and design new features of the app.
                 <br> 
                 I could figure out the reward system was educationally appropriate and enjoyable for users through usability tests. <br> 
                 Through interviewing the users, I learned how to communicate with the users of my own words and photos. <br> 
                 From this experience, I discovered that I love designing creative things that could help the users, especially the kids.
